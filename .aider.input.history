+can you add a nicer visualisation screen for when the transcription and summary are being made?

+thank you, can you now make it so that when processing the rest of all UI dissapears (or is hidden) and only the visualisation is shown?

+I want that when the upload is completed (or recording or typing), let's say when the input is ready, I want then that the screen switches to a loading screen where you see your nice animation together with (in nice UI design) an estimation of time left, and also what it is doing now, like a status update. E.g. "Transcriberen" "Samenvatten" "Controleren"
