+can you add a nicer visualisation screen for when the transcription and summary are being made?

# 2024-10-05 23:01:51.752531
+thank you, can you now make it so that when processing the rest of all UI dissapears (or is hidden) and only the visualisation is shown?

+I want that when the upload is completed (or recording or typing), let's say when the input is ready, I want then that the screen switches to a loading screen where you see your nice animation together with (in nice UI design) an estimation of time left, and also what it is doing now, like a status update. E.g. "Transcriberen" "Samenvatten" "Controleren"

+I want that new versions, like additions, alterations, or any "changes" that the user makes through the AI of the summary to be displayed in the summary screen, but not as an expandable, but as a new version of the summary. there is already UI with next and previous buttons. I want the new one to replace old, but still through those buttons give the user the possibility to back and forth through the different versions

+also, i want the visualation the kind of loading screen, to be the only thing visible when loading, so all the UI from the input to dissapear. so bascially 1. input 2. loading screen 3. summary. like kind of steps, do you understand? Also, now the loading bars are under each other which looks ugly, please refine the loading screen
